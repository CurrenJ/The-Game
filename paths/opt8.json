If it works, and by some miracle you do find this and open it, I'm sorry. I don't know how time passes for you. I don't even know what is reality anymore. I can only hope that you haven't been waiting for me for the 35 years that I've been trying to make it back to you. I love you, and I fear that I won't be able to ever make it back. I gave up on the quest five years ago. I just couldn't keep trying to win. It's not possible. Or maybe I just don't have the capacity. If you are reading this, it's time to move on. Don't waste your time looking for answers. God knows I have. There aren't any. I will yearn for you until my dying breath in this place. If I write too much more the file will be too large to send. You are and forever will be my one and only love. Don't play the game.\"", "0.7em"],
